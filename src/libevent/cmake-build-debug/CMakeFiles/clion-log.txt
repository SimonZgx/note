CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibevent.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "libevent",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libevent" with any
  of the following names:

    libeventConfig.cmake
    libevent-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libevent" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libevent_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libevent" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
